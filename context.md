## 1. What this is

A browser **activity game for kids** ("Bot Show"). The player charges a robot's
batteries: pick the low-battery bot, go inside it, and drag battery groups into
slots until current flows and it powers up.

- **Stack:** vanilla **HTML + CSS + JS** only. No framework, no build step, no
  bundler, no npm deps. Just open `index.html`.
- **Must stay responsive** for **mobile, tablet, desktop**.
- Built to match a **Figma** design 1:1.

### Figma source
- File key: `q3XTxsSPlAaNxQJoqde0Gr` (file name "Bot-show"), page "LBD 1" (`30:91`).
- Design frame size: **1920 × 1080** (16:9). All coordinates below are in this space.
- Current screen node ids: **Screen 1 = `160:3467`**, **Screen 2 = `163:3`**
  (the doc has older duplicates `30:*`/`31:*` — ignore those; the `16x:*` set is current).
- Figma is reachable via the Figma MCP connector (design-to-code). The avatar/bot
  art was exported from here.

**Script load order (in `index.html`, all `defer`):** `navigation.js`, `intro.js`,
`batteries.js`, `main.js`. They communicate via globals: `window.GameNav`,
`window.Batteries`, `window.Screen2Intro`.

---

## 3. The stage & responsive system (`main.css`)

- `.game` fills the viewport; the letterbox fill (bars outside the 16:9 stage) is set
  **per active screen** by `navigation.js` (a `LETTERBOX` map): purple `#0a0130` for the
  Pre-LBD splash, brown `#5a3624` for room screens (1/3/5/7), and a fixed cream
  `#FBE7CB` for interior screens (2/4/6/8) — matching the background outside the panel
  (same for every bot/level) — so the bars blend with each screen's edges.
- `.game__screen` (id `stage`) is a **fixed 16:9 box** sized to the largest that
  fits: `width: min(100vw, 100dvh * 1920/1080)`. It is **not** CSS-scaled — it
  renders at real pixels, so **1 viewport px == 1 stage px** (important for drag math).
- The stage is a **container** (`container-type: size; container-name: stage`),
  so children use **`cqw`** units (1cqw = 1% of stage width = 19.2px at design size)
  for things that must scale — fonts, borders, glows.
- Element positions are **percentages of the 1920×1080 frame** (e.g. left = pxX/1920·100).

**Responsiveness comes for free:** the whole stage scales as one unit; everything
inside is in % / cqw, so mobile/tablet/desktop all work. `responsive.css` has
empty breakpoint stubs for future per-device tweaks (none needed so far).

---

## 4. Screen system & navigation

- Two screens: `<section class="screen screen--1 is-active" id="screen-1">` and
  `<section class="screen screen--2" id="screen-2">`, both inside the stage.
- Only `.is-active` is visible. **Inactive screens stay painted** (`opacity:0`,
  `pointer-events:none`, NOT `visibility:hidden`) so they're already rasterized —
  this was deliberate to avoid a paint stall during the zoom transition.
- `js/navigation.js`: `GameNav.show("screen-1" | "screen-2")` toggles `.is-active`.
- **Deep links:** `index.html#2` (or `#screen-2`) opens Screen 2 directly and plays
  its intro — handy for testing/sharing.
- **Esc** returns to Screen 1 (dev convenience, in `main.js`).

---

## 4b. Pre-LBD — start screen (`screen--pre`, `main.css`)

The **first** screen on load (`is-active`). Full-screen `Pre_LBD.webp` splash
("FIX-A-BOT" title + the two bots + battery) with a big circular **play-icon** button
(`.play-btn--icon`, `#play-btn` — glossy orange disc + white ▶ triangle, bob + glow-ring
animation) on the floor. Clicking it (`main.js`) → `GameNav.show("screen-1")`
+ `Screen1Intro.play()`. Because of this, Screen 1's intro is **on-demand** now:
its CSS animations are scoped to `.screen--1.is-intro` and the typewriter runs from
`Screen1Intro.play()` (NOT on page load).

**Level transition = theatre curtains.** `#curtains` sits **outside `#stage`** (direct
child of `#game`) and is `position: fixed` so it covers the **whole viewport** including
the letterbox bars. Two velvet curtain halves. `showLevelTransition()` (main.js) closes them over the
finished level (showing "Level 1 Complete!" / "All Bots Fixed!"), swaps the screen
behind them, then parts them to reveal the next level — matching the auditorium-stage
theme. (The legacy `#screen-transition` card is no longer used.)

---

## 5. Screen 1 — choose the bot (`screen.css`)

- **Stage spotlight (animated cue):** Screen 1 first shows ALL bots at normal lighting;
  ~1s after it appears, `Screen1Intro.play()` adds `.is-lit` and the spotlight animates
  on — the beam (`.screen--1 .spotlight`) sweeps onto the centre bot (pivots at the top)
  and the dark radial vignette (`.screen--1::after`) fades in to push the side bots into
  shadow. Both are `opacity:0`/off by default and transition on with `.is-lit`. Replays
  reset `.is-lit` so the cue plays again each entry.
- **Hover** is only on the focal/clickable bot — `.bot--orange:hover` (L1 centre) and
  `.level-2 .bot--purple:hover` (L2 centre). `.bot` is `cursor:default`; only the focal
  bot is `cursor:pointer`. Side bots have no hover/pointer.
- **Levels:** L1 = guided tutorial (fixed 3-bot layout, orange focal). **From L2 = the
  bot chooser** (see below); the old single-bot `.level-2` repositioning rules are now
  superseded (the fixed bots are `display:none` in L2).

### Game structure: Tutorial + 4 levels (the L2+ bot chooser)
- **Tutorial** = the guided flow (charge → concept → split → concept), `gameStage 0`.
- **Levels 1-4** = the chooser. Each level fixes **TWO different bots in two phases**:
  1. **CHARGE phase** — the **low** bots are shown; tap one → charge puzzle (Part 1) →
     it dances (fixed).
  2. **SPLIT phase** — the **overcharged** bots appear, pulsing a red glow; tap one →
     split puzzle (Part 2) → it dances (fixed). Level complete → next level.
- **Low set** (charge phase): orange / blue / purple / pink — `<color>_bot[_low].webp`
  (red battery). Fixed → `<color>_bot_charged.webp` (green filled, dances).
- **Overcharged set** (split phase): a DISTINCT colour set **red / green / teal / yellow**
  so no colour is reused for both states. These are recoloured (hue-shift) from the low
  set's overcharged art via sharp (`red←orange -30`, `green←blue -75`, `teal←purple -125`,
  `yellow←pink +85`); their `_bot_charged.webp` (fixed/dancing) and `panel_<color>.webp`
  are recoloured the same way. The recolour keeps the **white "!"** but shifts the baked
  red glow, so a **CSS red chest glow** is layered on in the chooser
  (`.carousel-bot[data-state="overcharged"]::after`, screen-blend over the chest, + a red
  rim glow on the img) so it always reads "overcharged red". *(For a perfect baked red
  glow, swap in Figma-made art — the system is keyed by `data-scheme`.)*
- `data-scheme` (colour) + `data-state` (low|overcharged) on each `.carousel-bot`; charge
  phase shows the low bots, split phase the overcharged ones. (The old per-level
  `chargedColor`/`.is-locked` exclusion is now moot since the sets are different colours,
  but it's left in harmlessly.)
  - **Scroll hint:** the first time the chooser appears (Level 1, charge phase) the row
    pans **left → right → centre** (`scrollHint()` → `tweenScroll`, a `setTimeout`-stepped
    tween that's reliable; it retries until the row is laid out and adds `.no-snap` so
    scroll-snap doesn't fight it), ending centred with bots peeking on both sides — so the
    kid sees it scrolls. (Uses setTimeout-stepping, NOT rAF/`performance.now`, which don't
    advance under headless virtual-time and made the old `scrollTo` version flaky.)
  - **Closed banner:** the question template's closed clip is `inset(0 91.7% 0 0)` (was
    91.2%, which left a cream sliver with a hard cut to the right of the mascot badge).

### Chooser carousel (`carousel.js`, `index.html`, `screen.css`)
Horizontal **scrollable row** (`.bot-carousel__track`, only under `.level-2`), staged like
Screen 1 via coverflow: `carousel.js layout()` scales each bot by distance from centre
(centre big & front, sides small & set back), and each `.carousel-bot::before` is its floor
shadow. CSS shows only the current phase's un-fixed bots (`.phase-split` toggles low ↔
overcharged); fixed bots always stay, dancing.
- **Flow:** tap a bot → `select()` centres it, **spotlight falls** (`.is-choosing` dims the
  rest + `.is-lit`), then `chooseBotEnter(scheme, part)` (main.js) sets `panel_<scheme>` and
  zooms in (`enterBotTo`) → charge (`screen-2`, part 1) or split (`screen-6`, part 2).
- **After a puzzle**, `returnToChooser()` → `BotChooser.onFixed(scheme)`: marks that bot
  fixed (swaps to charged art + dances) and returns `{levelComplete}`. Charge done → straight
  to the split phase, with `enterChooser(true)` **centring the just-fixed bot in front** so
  the player sees it dancing (the next overcharged bot peeks on the side). `lastFixed` tracks
  it; the level-complete curtain re-enters with `enterChooser(false)` (fresh). Split done (both bots fixed) → **curtain** `playCurtain("Level N
  Complete!", …)` then the next level's chooser; after level 4 → `playCurtain("All Bots
  Fixed!", …)` → pre screen. (Tutorial→Level 1 uses `showLevelTransition()` = "Tutorial
  Complete!".) `playCurtain(title, sub, onSwap)` in main.js is the shared curtain helper.
- Counts per phase come from `window.STAGES[gameStage]` via `getCounts(1|2)` (see §8).
- `intro.js Screen1Intro.play()` is chooser-aware: in L2 it skips the auto-spotlight, calls
  `BotChooser.enterChooser()`, and types the L2 prompt (`data-text2`).
- Test via the dev menu → "Level 2 (Real Game) → 1 · Choose bot" (charge phase).
- Each bot's low-battery symbol is **baked into its art** (e.g. `orange_bot.webp` has the
  low-battery chest icon in the image). (An earlier `.chest-low` CSS overlay was removed
  once the bot art included the icon directly.)


Background = `BG.webp`. Contents:
- **Spotlight** `spotlight.svg` — full-height beam centered on the orange bot, z1.
- **Floor shadows + warm glow** — CSS radial-gradient `div`s (`.floor*`), recreated
  from Figma ellipses (those were blurred PNGs, not exported). z2/3.
- **Three bots** (`.bot`, sized by `width` %, positioned by Figma coords):
  - `.bot--purple` `purple_bot_low.webp` (low-battery purple) — left, tallest, back.
    Dimmed `filter: brightness(0.8)` so it recedes like the right bot; reset to full
    brightness when it becomes the L2 focal bot (`.level-2 .bot--purple`).
  - `.bot--orange` `orange_bot.webp` — center, focal, z6, **clickable** → Screen 2.
  - `.bot--white-blue` `White_blue_bot.webp` — right, smallest, back.
  - Subtle `:hover` scale. `decoding="async"` was REMOVED from bots (it caused a
    headless paint race / intermittent missing bot).
- **Question banner** `.question` (see §7) with text **"Tap the bot to fix its batteries."**

---

## 6. Zoom-into-bot transition (`main.css` + `main.js`)

Clicking the orange bot (`enterBot()` in `main.js`) plays a smooth dive into the
bot's **chest battery icon** then Screen 2 emerges. Key facts (tuned for smoothness):
- `transform-origin: 49.6% 73%` on `.screen--1.is-zooming` = the chest battery icon.
- Screen 1 zooms `scale(1)→scale(4.2)` + fades, easing `cubic-bezier(0.42,0,1,1)`,
  0.75s. **Scale capped at 4.2** (higher, e.g. 11×, blew the GPU texture limit and
  caused a re-raster hitch — do not raise much).
- Screen 2 (`.is-entering`) enters `scale(2)→scale(1)` + fades, same transform-origin,
  0.72s, decelerate easing.
- **Handoff at ~380ms** (`main.js` setTimeout): Screen 1 reaches ~2× exactly when
  Screen 2 starts at 2× → seamless, scale-matched crossfade (no jump).
- Only `transform`/`opacity` animate (compositor-friendly). No blur (blur re-rasters).
- At ~1200ms: cleanup + `Screen2Intro.play()` is called.

---

## 7. Question banner (shared) + the live mascot video

Used on **both** screens (any template with dialogue). Markup:
```html
<div class="question" [id="question-2" on screen 2]>
  <img class="question__template" src="assets/images/Question_template.webp">
  <video class="question__avatar" src="assets/videos/bite_talking.mp4" muted loop autoplay playsinline></video>
  <p class="question__text" data-text="...the line..."></p>
</div>
```
- `Question_template.webp` = the cream banner art with a mascot badge baked in at
  the left. The banner is positioned by Figma coords (left 1.458%, top 4.167%,
  width 97.135%).
- **`.question__avatar`** (in `screen.css`) overlays the **`bite_talking.mp4`** video
  on the badge face (muted, looping) → the mascot looks alive and talks. This
  replaces the static face. Same for all dialogue templates.
- **`.question__text`**: Rajdhani **Bold**, color `#4f2b0f`, `font-size: 2.344cqw`
  (= 45px at design), positioned over the cream bar. Text is stored in `data-text`
  and starts empty (no flash); JS types it in.

### Open/close animation
- **Screen 1** (`screen.css`, scoped to `.screen--1`): on load the banner pops in
  showing **only the mascot** (clip-path), then **unrolls open** (`templateUnroll`),
  then `intro.js` **typewrites** the text (45ms/char) — triggered on the template's
  `animationend`.
- **Screen 2**: class-driven, controlled by `intro.js` `playScreen2Intro()`:
  - `.screen--2 .question__template` is clipped closed (mascot only) by default;
    adding `.is-open` transitions clip-path to fully open (and removing it closes).
  - Sequence: open → type **"Drag the batteries in a small slots."** → **brief hold
    `HOLD_AFTER_TEXT = 600`ms** → close to just the mascot → ghost hint (non-blocking;
    dragging is already enabled). Kept short so the player can drag almost immediately.
  - **VO TODO:** replace the 600ms hold with the audio's `ended` event when VO exists.

---

## 8. Screen 2 — inside the bot (`screen2.css` + `batteries.js`)

Background = dark radial gradient. Structure:
```
#screen-2
├── .s2-content (#s2-content)        # gameplay layer; scaled during the banner intro
│   ├── img.panel (battery_slots.svg)            # full circuit-board panel: border+slots+connectors
│   ├── img.slot-glow.slot-glow--big (Bigger_Slot.svg)  # green charged-glow overlay (hidden until charged)
│   ├── .slot.slot--big / --small-left / --small-right  # invisible drop-zones
│   ├── svg.charge-fx (#charge-fx)               # current-flow overlay (see charge seq)
│   ├── .tray.tray--blue / .tray--yellow         # CSS-built trays (nested rounded rects + accent + decorator tabs)
│   └── (battery groups injected here by JS)
└── .question (#question-2)          # banner (NOT scaled) — see §7
```

### Panel & slots
- **Per-bot colour scheme (from Figma `287:719`):** each bot's interior board is a
  **filled colour** matching the bot. The board is a pre-rendered image
  `panel_<scheme>.webp` (1920×822, exported from the Figma "Main container" frames and
  stretched to the exact battery_slots canvas so slots line up). Schemes:
  **orange** = Part 1 L1, **purple** = Part 1 L2, **white** = Part 2 L1,
  **blue** = Part 2 L2 (the Part-2 bot is hue-blue in L2). `panel_pink.webp` is also
  exported (pink bot) but no current screen uses it.
  - `main.js setPanelScheme(screenIds, scheme)` swaps the `src` of every `img.panel`
    layer; called from `setupLevel()` → screens 2/4 get orange|purple, screens 6/8 get
    white|blue. All 4 panel layers (`.panel`, `.panel--small-left/right`, `.panel--big`)
    share the one scheme image.
  - **Background OUTSIDE the panel** is a fixed cream **`#FBE7CB`** on every interior
    screen (`.screen--2/4/6/8`) and the **letterbox** bars (`navigation.js LETTERBOX`) —
    the same for every bot/level (NOT tinted per bot).
  - **Board (INSIDE the panel)** keeps each bot's colour. The orange board was recoloured
    to **`#F5C99A`** (a soft peach) — `panel_orange.webp` was re-tinted with sharp
    (`modulate brightness 1.22 / saturation 0.55 / hue +5`) from the brighter Figma
    orange. The other boards stay their Figma colours.
  - **No more hue-rotate/grayscale board recolouring.** The board keeps its bot colour;
    charge **success** is signalled by the green **slot-glow** + green **current flow**
    (not the board), and Part 2 **overcharge** by the red/yellow/green **slot-glow** on
    the big slot. (The old `battery_slots.webp` / `battery_slots_white.webp` are now
    unused.)
- (Legacy) `battery_slots.svg` (true vector, ~280KB) is the **whole panel** (1834×786) at
  Figma (43,40): the metallic border, the 3 slots, the orange connectors, decorators.
- Trays are **recreated in CSS** (the tray SVGs had the batteries baked in, so they
  couldn't be emptied). Blue accent `#96f2f7`, yellow accent `#f3e21f`, grey rim `#5f5e5e`.
- **Slot inner rects (design px), used for layout + drop centers** — small slots were
  re-centred to the new filled panels (batteries were sitting low/bottom before):
  - big: `{x:715, y:143, w:501, h:250}` (centre 965,268)
  - small-left: `{x:425.5, y:552.5, w:407, h:139}` (centre **629, 622**)
  - small-right: `{x:1098.5, y:551.5, w:407, h:139}` (centre **1302, 621**)
  - (Same centres mirrored in `part2.js SLOTS`, `concept.js LAYOUT`, `part2.js C_LAYOUT`.)

### Per-stage battery counts (`main.js window.STAGES` / `getCounts(part)`)
The "whole" splits into two parts — **blue** group + **yellow** group. Counts vary by
stage (Tutorial + Levels 1-4) per the design table:

| Stage | Part 1 (charge) blue,yellow | Part 2 (split) blue,yellow |
|---|---|---|
| Tutorial | 4, 2 | 3, 2 |
| Level 1 | 3, 5 | 4, 3 |
| Level 2 | 6, 3 | 7, 3 |
| Level 3 | 6, 4 | 5, 4 |
| Level 4 | 6, 6 | 6, 5 |

`window.gameStage` indexes `STAGES`; `getCounts(1|2)` returns `{blue,yellow}`. Wired into
`batteries.js setupBatteries` (Part 1), `part2.js startSplit` (Part 2) and `concept.js`.
`setupLevel(2)` starts the chooser at `gameStage 1`; the chooser then advances
`gameStage` 1→4 as each level is completed. A small slot fits up to **7** batteries at
`PLACED_SCALE 0.82` (8 overflows — that's why Level 2's split is **(7,3)** not (2,8)).
In the chooser's **split phase** the banner reads "Oh no! A few bots are overcharged —
tap one to fix it." (`Screen1Intro.setText`, a cancellable typer).

### Batteries & drag-drop (`batteries.js`)
- Two **groups** (single draggable units, NOT individual batteries); counts come from
  `getCounts()` above (defaults blue 4 / yellow 6):
  - blue tray center `(506.5, 948.5)`
  - yellow tray center `(1413.5, 948.5)`
  - battery art = `blue_battery.png` / `yellow_battery.png` (62×100, transparent,
    exported isolated from Figma with `contentsOnly`). Single battery = `3.229cqw` wide.
- A group is positioned by its **center** (`left/top` %, `translate(-50%,-50%)`).
- **`PLACED_SCALE = 0.82`** — uniform battery size in **every** slot (sized so the
  6-yellow group fits the smallest slot; never overflows). Tray = scale 1.
- **Only the two bottom slots** (`small-left`, `small-right`) accept drops. The big
  (top) slot is the auto-charge destination, not a manual target.
- Drag = Pointer Events (mouse + touch). While dragging, full size; drop on a slot →
  snaps to slot center at `PLACED_SCALE`; drop elsewhere → animates home. Slot under
  pointer highlights (`.slot.is-hover`).
- Dragging is **gated** by `enabled` (Battery API). It's OFF during the Screen 2
  intro and ghost hint, then turned ON.

### Charge sequence (when BOTH bottom slots filled)
`startCharge()`:
1. Current flows up through the connectors — `#charge-fx` SVG overlay, paths trace
   the **exact connector centerlines**:
   - **Re-calibrated to the new filled panels** (the connectors/slots shifted ~10-15px
     vs the old `battery_slots` art): left `M660,540 L748,420`, right `M1260,540 L1172,420`,
     horizontal glow `M850,628 L1070,628`. (The concept's small-slot glows in `screen4.css`
     were likewise nudged to the new slot positions: `top ~50.5%`, `width 21.72%`.)
   - bright pulses travel (dash animation) on the **two diagonals only** (bottom→top);
     the horizontal left→right connector is intentionally NOT flow-animated — it's
     omitted from the `.charge-flow` group (kept in `.charge-glow` for the green end-glow).
2. (+500ms) both groups travel **up into the big slot** as two rows (blue top y217,
   yellow bottom y319, center x965.5), uniform `PLACED_SCALE`.
3. (+1400ms) `#charge-fx` turns **green** (`.is-green` → `.charge-glow` paths) and the
   **big slot glows green**.
- **Big-slot green glow**: NOT a box-shadow. It's `.slot-glow--big` = a
  **`Bigger_Slot.svg`** overlay sitting exactly on the big slot, with a green
  **`drop-shadow`** so the glow **hugs the slot's real rounded shape + tabs**.
  It pulses by fading the overlay's opacity (`slotGlowPulse`) while the orange slot
  underneath stays put. (This replaced an earlier boxy box-shadow that looked bad.)
- After charging, dragging is locked (`charged = true`).

### "Fully charged" finale (`fullyCharged()` in `batteries.js`, ~3.6s after charge starts)
Once the batteries are in the big slot and it's glowing green, the finale plays
(all animated, sequenced):
1. **Battery trays + their placeholder ghosts fade out** (`.tray`, `.tray-ghost`),
   then are `display:none`'d so nothing lingers.
2. **The board slides down** to fill the now-empty bottom — `.s2-content.is-charged-final`
   = `transform: translateY(15%)` (everything moves together, stays aligned).
3. **The banner re-opens** and types **"The bot is fully charged."** via
   `Screen2Intro.showMessage(text)` (opens, types, stays open).
4. **~3.2s after the finale starts** (a brief beat after the message — tune with VO),
   it transitions to **Screen 3** via `GameFx.exitBot()`
   — the **reverse** of the enter-zoom: we pull back OUT of the chest (same 49.6%/73%
   focal point), the interior recedes, and the whole charged bot is revealed shrinking
   from a chest close-up to normal size (`zoomOutOfBot` + `revealBot` in `main.css`).
> NOTE: the codebase has user edits around the charge sequence — e.g. the panel
> turns green via `.panel.is-green { filter: hue-rotate(110deg) }`, batteries do a
> FLIP-style travel into the big slot with low-opacity ghost trails, and there are
> `.panel--small-left/right/big` clip overlays. The `.tray-ghost` class on the
> permanent 20%-opacity tray placeholders is what the finale fades out.

### Screen 2 intro flow (the full on-enter sequence)
zoom inside → `.s2-content.is-compact` (content shrinks **and shifts down** so the
banner has a clear gap above the panel: `transform: translateY(10%) scale(0.85)`) →
banner opens + types prompt → holds 3.5s → banner closes to mascot + content grows
back to normal (smooth) → **ghost hint** demonstrates the drag **3×** (a translucent
blue group glides tray→small-left slot, `.is-ghost`) → dragging enabled.

> **Level 2 = play solo.** L2 is no longer a tutorial: `playHint()` skips the ghost
> demo (just enables dragging) when `window.currentLevel === 2`, and **both concept
> screens are skipped** in L2 — Part 1 (`batteries.js`) goes charge → reveal dance
> (Screen 3) → Part 2 directly (no Screen 4), and Part 2 (`part2.js onFixed`) goes
> split → reveal dance (Screen 7) → level transition directly (no Screen 8). L1 still
> shows the ghost hint and both concept screens.

## 8b. Screen 3 — the bot celebrates (`screen3.css`)

The celebration screen. Same room background as Screen 1
(`var(--bg-image)` = BG.webp) + the `spotlight`, with the **charged bot centered**:
`.charged-bot` wraps `orange_bot_charged.webp` (placeholder — **swap for a dancing
video later**). It does a gentle CSS "dance" loop (`botDance`: bob + sway, pivot at
feet) while `.screen--3.is-active`. Markup is a `<section class="screen screen--3"
id="screen-3">` inside the stage.

**Order:** the dance comes **AFTER the concept** (Screen 4), not before. The
concept screen zooms OUT of the board to reveal the dancing bot
(`concept.js revealDancingBot()` → `.screen--4.is-zooming-out` + `.screen--3.is-revealing`,
reusing the `zoomOutOfBot`/`revealBot` keyframes). It dances ~3s, then Part 2 begins.

---

## 8c. Screen 4 — concept "2 parts make a whole" (`screen4.css` + `concept.js`)

Reached straight from Screen 2's finale (`batteries.js`, ~3.2s after charging —
**stays inside the bot**, no dance yet). After the concept teaches, it zooms out
to reveal the dancing bot (Screen 3), which then leads into Part 2.
Uses the **charged (green) panel** look from Screen 2's end state — same layered
panel imgs (`panel is-green` + `panel--small-left/right` orange overlays +
`panel--big is-green`) — and `.s4-content { transform: translateY(14%) }` nudges the
board down so the whole panel clears the banner and is fully visible.
Dark interior bg + batteries in all three slots:
- **small-left** = 4 blue (part 1), **small-right** = 6 yellow (part 2),
- **big** = 4 blue (top row) + 6 yellow (bottom row) = the whole.
`concept.js` builds the battery groups (display-only, `SCALE 0.82`) and plays a
two-phase animation synced to the banner prompt **"These 2 parts make this whole."**:
- **Phase A ("These 2 parts")**: starts as the prompt begins typing; the big-slot
  batteries dim to 20% (`.battery.is-dim`); the two **part SLOTS glow one by one**
  (`.slot-glow--small-left` then `--small-right`, `SLOT_GLOW_STAGGER` apart;
  Smaller_Slot.svg overlays). The batteries themselves do NOT glow.
- **Phase B ("make this whole.")**: the part-slot glows turn off + their batteries dim;
  the big-slot batteries go full opacity and the big slot glows green
  (`.slot-glow--big.is-charged`).
Phase timings are **placeholders for the VO** (`SLOT_GLOW_STAGGER`, `PHASE_GAP` in concept.js).
`.screen--4 .battery.is-dim` is scoped so Screen 2 is unaffected. Deep-link: `index.html#4`.

## 8d. PART TWO — fixing overcharged bots (`part2.css` + `part2.js`)

The inverse of Part One: bots are **overcharged** (the whole is too full), and the
child **splits** the whole into two parts. Starts **automatically** after Part One's
Screen 4 concept finishes (`concept.js` → `GameNav.show("screen-5")` + `Part2.startIntro()`).

Screens (continue the `screen--N` numbering; deep-links `#5`–`#8`):
- **Screen 5** (`screen--5`, intro): room bg + 3 bots in a `.s5-stage` wrapper
  (left `purple_bot.webp`, centre overcharged `White_purple_bot.webp`, right
  `orange_bot_charged.webp`). Three-phase choreography (in `Part2.startIntro`):
  **A** all bots equally lit (spotlight hidden) — "Oh no! A few bots have overcharged.";
  **B** spotlight fades in on centre + sides darken (`.screen--5.is-spotlit`) — "Let's
  start fixing this bot."; **C** side bots fade out (`.is-gone`) + the scene zooms in a
  little (`.s5-stage.is-focusing` scale 1.4, origin 50.7%/70%) — "Let us split its
  batteries." Tapping the centre bot (`enterFromFocus`) continues that zoom into Screen 6.
  The banner (sibling of `.s5-stage`) is NOT scaled by the little zoom.
  - The **spotlight sweeps** onto the centre bot like a real stage light: it pivots at
    its top (`transform-origin:50% 0`) from `rotate(-20deg)` → `0`, fading in fast so the
    movement reads.
  - The purple (left) bot's "!" overcharge mark is baked into `purple_bot.webp`
    (528×621 source). The center bot's mark is likewise part of `White_purple_bot.webp`.
- **Screen 6** (`screen--6`, split puzzle): the **big slot starts FULL** (blue row +
  yellow row, green `panel--big is-green`); small slots empty. Banner prompts "Drag the
  batteries to the small slots." then closes; the player drags each group **big → small**.
  When **both small slots are filled**, `onFixed()` shows "This bot is fixed." then
  goes **straight to the concept** (Screen 8) — stays inside the bot. (Same drag
  pattern as Part 1, reversed direction.)
- **Screen 8** (`screen--8`, concept): "This whole is made of these 2 parts." — the
  **inverse** of Screen 4: Phase A "This whole" → big slot glows; Phase B "…2 parts" →
  the two part slots glow one by one. Reuses `.s4-content`, glows, battery layout.
  After teaching, `playConcept2()` **zooms OUT** (`zoomOutTo("screen-8","screen-7")`,
  `.screen--8.is-zooming-out`) to reveal the dancing bot.
- **Screen 7** (`screen--7`, celebrate): `White_purple_bot_charged.webp` dances under
  the spotlight (reuses `.charged-bot`/`botDance`). After ~3s → `showLevelTransition()`.
  **Note the order: concept (8) BEFORE the dance (7)**, same as Part 1.

All Part-2 logic is in `part2.js` (`Part2.startIntro/startSplit/playConcept2`), styles in
`part2.css` (scoped `.screen--5/6/7/8`, reusing all shared components + the zoom keyframes).
Timings are VO-placeholders. **No new assets needed** (uses existing webp).

## 9. Assets (`assets/images/`)

**Load performance:** initial payload was trimmed from ~2.9 MB to ~0.5 MB on first
paint:
- The avatar video `bite_talking.mp4` was re-encoded 1.3 MB → ~63 KB (it shows at ~110px).
- `battery_slots*.svg` panels → `.webp` (~280K → ~60K each).
- **Deferred loading:** heavy images that never appear on Screen 1 (Part-2 bots, panels,
  slot art) use `data-src` instead of `src`; `main.js` swaps them to `src` on
  `window.load` (after first paint). So Screen 1 shows fast and the rest streams in.
- **Unused source files** (the original `.svg`/`BG.png`, trays, etc.) were moved to a
  top-level `_source/` folder — exclude it from deploy. `assets/` is now ~1.5 MB.
  NOTE: `blue_battery.svg`/`yellow_battery.svg` are referenced **dynamically** in JS
  (`color + "_battery.svg"`) — keep them even though static scans flag them as unused.

**Performance history (important):** the original "SVG" bot/banner files were huge
**raster images wrapped in SVG** (Screen 1 alone was ~8.7MB and loaded slowly when
deployed). They were re-encoded to **WebP** at display resolution (~95% smaller).
**Use the `.webp` versions** for raster art. The originals (`.svg`/`.png`) are kept
but unused — they bloat the deploy upload (~17MB) and can be removed if desired.

| In use | Asset | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `BG.webp` | Screen 1 background (was BG.png 1.8MB → 41KB) |
| ✅ | `Question_template.webp` | cream banner + mascot badge (both screens) |
| ✅ | `purple_bot_low.webp` / `orange_bot.webp` / `White_blue_bot.webp` | Screen 1 bots (left/centre/right). `orange_bot.webp` (←`orange_bot.svg`, 900px) and `purple_bot_low.webp` (←`purple_bot_low.svg`, 950px) are regenerated via sharp (q82); their art has the low-battery icon baked into the chest. `purple_bot_low.webp` doubles as the L2 focal bot. |
| ✅ | `Sahdow_Purple_Bot.webp` | dimmed "shadow" purple bot — now used only as the Part 2 Screen 5 left/side bot (L1). |
| ✅ | `blue_bot_low.webp` / `pink_bot_low.webp` | low-battery blue & pink bots for the L2+ chooser carousel (exported from Figma `284:11` / `286:94`). |
| ✅ | `White_purple_bot.webp` (overcharged) / `White_purple_bot_charged.webp` (fixed) | Part 2 centre bot |
| ✅ | `purple_bot.webp` / `orange_bot_charged.webp` | Part 2 Screen 5 side bots |
| ✅ | `panel_orange.webp` / `panel_purple.webp` / `panel_white.webp` / `panel_blue.webp` / `panel_pink.webp` | per-bot **filled colour** interior boards (1920×822), exported from Figma `287:719` "Main container" frames. Swapped per level by `setPanelScheme()`. pink = exported, unused. |
| ⚠️ unused | `battery_slots.webp` / `battery_slots_white.webp` | old dark-board/outline panels — superseded by the filled `panel_*.webp` set. |
| ✅ | `Bigger_Slot.svg` | **true vector** — big-slot green-glow overlay |
| ✅ | `spotlight.svg` | true vector (1KB) |
| ✅ | `blue_battery.svg` / `yellow_battery.svg` | draggable battery art — Pre-LBD style (metallic cap/bands, glossy body, lightning bolt), 62×100 viewBox. JS builds them via `color + "_battery.svg"`. (old `.png` versions superseded) |
| ✅ | `bite_talking.mp4` | live mascot avatar video — re-encoded small (384px, ~63K) since it shows at ~110px |
| ⚠️ unused | `screen2_avatar.png` | old static avatar; replaced by the video |
| ⚠️ unused | `Blue_tray.svg` / `Yellow_tray.svg` | trays are now CSS (had batteries baked in) |
| ⚠️ unused | `slots.svg`, `Smaller_Slot.svg`, `Closed_Question_template.*`, `*_charged.*`, all original `.svg`/`BG.png` | not referenced (kept for future / source) |

To re-convert raster→WebP later: `sharp` was used in a temp `.build/` dir (now deleted).

## 10. JS public API (globals)

```js
GameNav.show(screenId)                 // "screen-1" | "screen-2"
Batteries.init()                        // auto-runs on DOMContentLoaded
Batteries.setEnabled(bool)              // gate drag interaction
Batteries.playHint()                    // run the 3× ghost drag demo, then enable
Screen2Intro.play()                     // open banner → type → hold → close → hint
Screen2Intro.showMessage(text)          // open banner, type `text`, leave open (finale message)
GameFx.exitBot()                        // Screen 2 -> 3 reverse (zoom-out) transition (4.2x mirror)
ConceptScreen.play()                    // Screen 4 part/whole teaching animation
```

Key tunables:
- `intro.js`: `TYPE_SPEED = 45` (ms/char), `HOLD_AFTER_TEXT = 3500` (banner open hold).
- `batteries.js`: `PLACED_SCALE = 0.82`, `GROUPS`, `SLOTS`, `BIG_ROW`, hint timings.
- `main.js`: zoom handoff `380`ms, cleanup `1200`ms.

## 11b. Dev menu (TEMPORARY)

`js/devmenu.js` adds a ☰ hamburger (top-left) that opens a list to jump to any
screen — for testing without playing through. Sections: **Tutorial** (each screen),
**Levels 1-4 (chooser)** — charge phase, split phase, the charge/split puzzles, the
level-complete curtain — and **Test a level's counts** (jump into the chooser at L1-L4).
Helpers: `chooser(stage, splitPhase)`, `chooserPuzzle(stage, part, scheme)`,
`BotChooser.reset()`. Self-contained (injects its own CSS/DOM). **Remove for production:** delete the file
and its `<script src="js/devmenu.js">` tag in index.html. Reload for a clean state
(jumps don't cancel a previous screen's pending timers).

---

## 11c. QA comment tool — freeze integration

The `/qa/` comment tool (Supabase-backed) lets reviewers pin comments on the UI.
When a reviewer opens the comment box it adds **`qa-intercept-on`** to `<body>`.
Because this game runs almost everything on **JS timers** (`setTimeout` for the
intro typewriter, charge/spotlight sequences, level curtains, and the
`GameNav.show()` screen swaps), the QA tool's own freeze (which only pauses CSS
on a `.level-intro-overlay` this game doesn't use) couldn't stop the action while
someone typed a comment. So the game honours the flag itself, in **three layers**:
- **`js/qa-freeze.js`** (loaded FIRST, before the other game scripts) — the main
  fix. It wraps the global `setTimeout`/`setInterval` so that while
  `body.qa-intercept-on` is set, **game** callbacks don't run: due timeouts are
  HELD and replayed in order the instant the class is removed (comment box
  closed), and game interval ticks are skipped. **QA's own timers are exempt**
  (detected via the call stack containing `/qa/`) so the comment box still focuses
  and toasts/sync still work. clearTimeout/clearInterval are unaffected (native
  ids). A `MutationObserver` on `<body>`'s class drives pause/resume.
- **`navigation.js`**: belt-and-suspenders — while comment mode is on,
  `GameNav.show()` also holds the current screen and stashes the latest target in
  `pendingScreen`, flushed on resume (catches any synchronous nav, e.g. Esc).
- **`main.css`**: `body.qa-intercept-on #stage *` gets
  `animation-play-state: paused` + `transition: none`, freezing pure-CSS loops
  (bot dance, spotlight) and snapping in-flight transitions (scoped to `#stage`;
  the QA UI lives on `<body>` and keeps animating).
All of this is **inert during normal play** — the class only exists in QA mode.

---

## 12. Previewing / testing

- Just open `index.html` in a browser.
- `index.html#2` → jump straight to Screen 2 (plays its intro). Esc → back to Screen 1.
- Headless screenshots (used during dev), Windows + Edge:
  ```
  msedge --headless --disable-gpu --no-sandbox --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required ^
    --user-data-dir=%TEMP%\p --window-size=1600,900 --virtual-time-budget=3000 ^
    --screenshot=out.png "file:///F:/CG Game/Bot-show/LBD-1/index.html"
  ```
  Note: with the autoplaying `<video>`, virtual-time capture desyncs animation timing
  slightly (video uses real time) — trust the code ordering over a single frame.

---

## 13. Open questions / TODO

- **VO:** swap `HOLD_AFTER_TEXT` (3500ms) for the voice-over audio's `ended` event
  when audio is provided, so banners stay open exactly as long as the VO.
- **After charging:** the "fully charged" finale now plays (trays out, board slides
  down, banner says "The bot is fully charged."). Could chain to a next screen from here.
- **Ghost hint** currently only demos blue→small-left; could also demo yellow→small-right.
- **Bottom slots** don't get the green SVG glow (only the top slot does) — by request,
  but could be extended.
- **Game rules:** drops are currently free (any group → either bottom slot). No
  color→slot validation / win check beyond "both bottom slots filled".
- **Cleanup:** unused original assets (§9) can be deleted to slim the deploy.

---

## 14. Conventions

- Clean, modular structure: one `index.html`, CSS split by screen/function, JS split
  by function. Match existing naming (BEM-ish: `.question__template`, `.bot--orange`).
- All new positioned elements: use Figma coords as % of 1920×1080; use `cqw` for
  sizes/borders/glows that must scale.
- Prefer `transform`/`opacity` for animation (smooth). Avoid animating `filter: blur`
  or scaling layers beyond ~4–5× (raster hitches).
